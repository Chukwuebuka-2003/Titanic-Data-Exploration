# Titanic-Data-Exploration
In this project, i wrote a python script that downloaded the required dataset from the given website.
I used the data set to execute an exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset.
My conclusions gotten from the dataset, can be found in the jupyter file attached in this repository

# Here are some conclusions:

55% of passengers that ebarked from S(Southampton) survived
38% of passengers that embarked from C(Cherbourg) survived
33% of passengers that embarked from Q(Queenstown) survived

1st class ticket passengers had higher survival rate
Female passengers had a higher survival rate than male passengers
Passengers that embarked their journey from Cherbourg survived the crisis
